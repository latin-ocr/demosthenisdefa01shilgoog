APPENDIX C. 287

cited passages I conceive the oripinol idea os o aegalim
is visible ι

My examination of Plato also bears testimony to thie
opinion: but ae I em unwilling to carry out this Ap-
pendix to further length, I will refer the reader to Ast's
Index.

I infer, then, that ναὶ is fundamentally connected
with e negative idea: that its affirmative usage is purely
accidental¹, end always, when so employed, serves to
strengthen the words coming from the preceding speaker,
by way of taking an objection to their sufficiency: thet
in a considerable number of instances the negative idea
predominates: aud that in the Oratore, at any rate, it is
never met with in a strictly affirmative signification.
The last remark will of course be confirmed, or rectified,
by examples which I shall feel thanlrful to be furnished
with: for Ι hold myself c lover of truth and for truth's
sake, and am wishful to adopt as my motto tho words of
Socrates with reference to this question or any opinion
raised in this Volume: ἐγῶ δὲ τίνων εἰμι’, τῶν ἡδέως μὲν ἂν

ἐλεγχθέντων, εἴ τι μὴ α’ληθὲς λέγω, ἡδέως δ’ ἂν ἐλεγξάντων,
εἴ τίς τι μή ἀληθὲς λέγοι, οὐκ ἀηδέστερον μέντ’ ἂν ἐλεγχθέν·

ἢ ἄλλον ἀπαλλάξαι. (Plat. Gorg. 458 A.)⁹
