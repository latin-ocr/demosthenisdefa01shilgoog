mood¹. The latter part⁹ of the rule (μὴ following ὥστε
with the infinitiva) appears occasionally to be violated. I
will first however, in passing, speek of the difference be-
tween the two modes of expression.

Matthiae, Gr. Gr. ᾖ 629 n. c, remarks: “I have not yet
bean able to satisfy myself whether any and what differ-
ence exists between the constructiones ὥστε with an infi-
nitive and indicative. Hermann, ad Vigen, p. 852 n,
352 b, seems to suppose an anacoluthon when ὥστε is
joined with an indicative.'' Hermann’s words are rather
tenebricoso, and may possibly not be rightly understood:
and I do not rememberwhether he has elsewhere ex-
plained himself more clearly. The difference seems simply
to be this: οὕτως ἄφρων ἦν ὥστε οὐκ ἐβούλετο· “he was so
foolish that he did not wish‚'' (expressive of the real
result or consequence). οὕτως ἄφρων ἦν ὥστε μὴ βούλε-
σθαι· “he was so foolish as not to wish,’' (expressive of the
natural consequence). In Latin the distinction might be

ἵ marked by translating the somer, ut nolucrit, the latter,
ut nodet. Now it is obvious that an energetic speaker,
wishing to express that the result (was not only of s

nature to follow, but) actually did follow, would employ
the indicative: whereas in ordinary and unimpessicncd
language tlte infinitiva would imply all that was necessary,
tlte astarot consequence supposing tlte recl. Accordingly
in the Oratore, much more frequently than in other

writers, the construction ὥστε or (ὥστε οὗ) with the indi-
cative occurs.
