APPENDIX O. 285

have arisen from the use of the negative, like our ‘nay,'
immo, or anai (ante) in Italianl which are negative in-
asmuoh as they object to the preceding phrase as not
being strong enough, whilet they agree with its general
meaning, and enhanee its fornel Certainly in these casea
the negative and affirmative senses often approach very
near to one another, as, , for instance, in the following
passage of B. J onson: ‘A good manethon profita by his .
endeavour, gea, when absent· marry when dead, by his
example and memoryffl

There appears to me to be great truth ιο this remark.
However, I haveat present nothing to do with the
investigation of the Latin ιιι, or the English noy, but
will endeavoirr, irem the Greek authors, to ascertain the
meaning of ναί. I have observed in· the Oratore the
following passages. Dem. de Ooron. p. 310 §251 ναί,
φησίν· ἅλλιὶ τό τοῦ Κεφάλου καλόν, τὰ μηδεμίαν γραφὴν
φυγεῖν. Aristoer. p. 652 ἓ 96 ναί· πῶς; ἐγὼ διδάξω.
[Dem.] Aristog. p. 791 ἓ 72 ναί, φησίν· α’δίκως γάρ μ’ “
ἐγγέγραφεν. Pantaenet. 977 5 36 ναί, φησίν· ἀλλὰ κᾶν
ἄλλο τι α’δικῇ τις περὶ τιὶ μέταλλα, καὶ τούτων εἰσὶ δίκαι.

‘hoschia de (ieron. ᾖ 28 p. 57 St: 423 R ναί· ἀλλ’ ἀντι-

διαπλέκει πρός τοῦτο εὐθὺς ὥς οὔτ’ ἔλαχε τειχοποιὸς οὔτ’

ἐχειροτονήθη ὑπὸ τοῦ δήμου. § 48 p. 60: 437 ναί· εἴ γε’ σε’
τις ἄλλη πόλις στεφανοῖ· εἰ δέὄ δῆμος ὅ Ἀθηναίων. §84
p. 65 :478 rai· ἀλλὰ χαλκοῖς καὶ ἀδαμαντίνοις τείχεσιν, οἷς
αὐτός φησι, τήν χώραν ἡμῶν ἐτείχισε. Dinaroh. e. Demosth.
§lp 91 St. :6 R. ναί· κατέψευσται γὰρ ἦ βουλή Δημο·
σθένους. In all these passages I eonoeive it will be granted
that ναί has at least a qaaeiaeqative meaning, answering
to our “ nay;” and in faot does aot so moola serve the par-
. pore of affirmiap the preceding position, as ⁰f asteriam
io tlte satiauerat objectiva.

⁴ Inow oome to the use of the word in other writers.
It occurs in Homer’s Iliad seventimesz't. 234 ναὶ μὰ
