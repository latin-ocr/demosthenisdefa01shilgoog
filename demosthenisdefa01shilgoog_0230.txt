Aeschines prosecuted and de-
prived of his franchise one of
his accusers. What is the re·
sult of this? Το wit, he will
meet with no commiseration,
no follow-feeling at your hands.
Nay more, in his accusation he
chose torevlleme. And what
is the result oi this? Iwho
know his willanous conduct
better than any one shall meet
with your greater forbearance
in my conducting tbe present
prosecution than I otherwise
should have done, because as
one of his eollesgues, the task
lhave undertaken naturally is
somewhat invidious. Nay more:
he has by his artifices put off
the trial so long, that it has
fallen upon a most critical
period, at which, such are the
events that have occurred sub-
sequently to tbe embassy, you
cannot cboose but condemnhim
if you have any regard for your
own security. lnalltbis Iac-

5291. ὑπακούσαντα] “One
who, when called upon, obeyed
thecall.” Timarchus did not
volunteer to conduct the prose
oution against Aeschines, did
not come iorward as a συκο-
φάντης, or irem any personui
vindictive motivo, but from
patriotic feeling andin obedi·
ence to the wishe‘s of his friends
and all loyal citizens. For
ὑπακούειν, “to get up to apeak
when called upon,” see below
p. 4345332. [I donotcaneel
the above, but O. R. Kennedy's
version “disfranchised an ec·
cuserwhoobeyedhiscballenge”
may be considered by some
readers more satisfactory. f
third interpretation may be
suggested; ·‘ who did n'ot rethe
