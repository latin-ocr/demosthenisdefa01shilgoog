APPENDIX A.

Vamous constructions after words of ιἴιοιιίιρ are ex·
amined by Hermann on Viger, n. 265, with his usual
minuteness and refinement, though he has. lest some un-
noticod. The mood ordinmily used, inasmuch as ιο secr
properly implies a sature idea, is the subjunctive. But,
as in our own idiom “I sear you have mistaken the
meaning,'’ intends to convey no doubt or uncertainty as

’ for 3, 4, 5, and 6, the Latius have no distinctiva mode of

of doing it,'' which is used to express an uncertainty
whether the event is on the point of being done, buta
probability that it is. 2. “I am afraid that you will do
it.” 3. “I am afraid that you are doing it:'' ιο use a
