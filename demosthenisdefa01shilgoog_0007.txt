’ Mr unsa Sue, Ι

Iam highly gratified in being permitted
to dedicate this Volume to you, one of the most dis·
tinguished Pupils of our common Mamer, Samuel,

ἱ sometime Lord Bishop of Lichfield.

Ι had ‘the good fortune to commenoe my uca-
demioal career under your Tuition before higher
'duties called you from Trinity College. My recol-
lectione of that period, and more enlarged experienoe
since, assure me that Ι cannot usher this Edition
into the world under more favourable auspices than
the sanction of your name: and I most gladly em·
brace the opportunity now afforded me of expressing
at once the hig'h esteem which, in common'with all,

Ι entertaiu towards you, and my grateful sense of
your unvaried kindness.

Believe me to remeia,
My dear Sir,
Ever yours most faithfully,
RIOHARD SHILLETO.

Omoemus,
November 28. 1⁸44.
